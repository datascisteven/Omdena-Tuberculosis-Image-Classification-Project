RUL apical fibrotic disease with some calcifications; extensive irregular infiltrates in left lung with a large area of cavitation/ findings consistent with old inactive disease in RL and new active TB in LL. On the lordotic view, in the rt apex a large thin walled cavity is visible, making active disease in the area likely as well.
